<br/>

To run this project locally,
- Copy & paste provided Mongo Key in place of `PASTE MONGO KEY HERE` in `MongoKey.js` from the project directory (the Mongo Key should still remain a string value so the single apostrophes signifying the key as a string must remain)
- `cd` into `frontend` directory and run `npm i`
- `cd` into `backend` directory and run `npm i`
- While in `backend` directory, run `npm start`
- Fire up a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`
